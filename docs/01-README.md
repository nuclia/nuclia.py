# Nuclia CLI/SDK

This SDK/CLI is designed to facilitate use of the Nuclia API.

There are two developer experiences:

- CLI: by using the cli `nuclia` you can interact with Nuclia via command line
- SDK: Using python you can replicate each command using the same structure

It requires Python (â‰¥3.8) and can be installed with:

```sh
pip install nuclia
```
